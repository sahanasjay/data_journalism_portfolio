# Sahana's Data Journalism Work Samples
* work sample 1
* work sample 2 
* work sample 3
## Overview
 
This repository exists to show examples of the code I have written as a data journalist at the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism, and as deputy managing editor for The Diamondback. 

The code samples are chosen to display my growth since first learning basic R in Fall 2020. Since then, I've written a worked as a data journalist for the Howard Center, acquiring more skills and securing a summer internship on the investigative center's data team. 

The majority of the code in this repository was written by me.

## Analysis of national OSHA records

The weighted comparative analysis in [OSHA_investigation_samples.Rmd](https://github.com/sahanasjay/data_journalism_portfolio/blob/main/howard_center_OSHA_investigation_examples/OSHA_investigation_samples.Rmd) on OSHA complaints in federal and state-plan states returned one of the key findings in the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism's stories on worker safety during COVID-19. 

The analysis I did to get a count of outbreaks in New Mexico stores revealed that nearly all the Walmart-owned stores in the state had seen an associated coronavirus outbreak.

Working on this project has exponentially increased my data analysis skills: in addition to learning how to create for loops and functions, I grew more comfortable with baseR, the tidyverse package, the lubridate package, the janitor package and many others. 

I have a byline on the project, which was published on [AP](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-business-caf5e31d883a18deae6cd367a5ee8978) and picked up by several notable outlets — including [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/walmart-sales-soared-essential-workers-got-scant-protection/2021/05/12/a4fe5d6a-b33f-11eb-bc96-fdf55de43bef_story.html).

## Analysis of Southern Poverty Law center's Whose Heritage database

I went through the process of creating a data-driven story, spearheading a small group of classmates to parse the Southern Poverty Law Center's "Whose Heritage?" database, which contains a count of statues, placards, public parks, buildings and other symbols dedicated to the Confederacy.

My analysis led to the finding that Northern states, though they have less confederate symbols than Southern states, have a higher percentage of symbols removed. Additionally, I pinpointed three trees named after Robert E. Lee in California National Parks that hadn't been removed or renamed, even after almost half of the state's confederate symbols had been taken down. 

I edited, cleaned and commented all code for this project, and wrote the majority of it.

## Analysis of College Park housing prices  

Even before I began learning how to code, I was writing data-driven stories. [This one](https://dbknews.com/2019/12/29/umd-college-park-student-housing-rent-prices-expensive-vacancy-commons-varsity-view/) centers on the astronomical student housing prices in College Park, Maryland — and why they're unlikely to come down anytime soon. 

I researched and analyzed historical and current price ranges for several of the most popular housing developments in the area, finding that monthly rent went up by as much as $30 for some developments in 2019.

## Reverse engineering project 

I went through the process of [recreating core findings](https://github.com/sahanasjay/data_journalism_portfolio/blob/main/reverse_engineering_project/analysis.Rmd) from "[Out of control](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-street-racing/)", a story about street racing fatalities from the Los Angeles Times.

I edited, cleaned and commented all of the code for this project, and wrote a significant portion of it. 

See my work [here](https://github.com/sahanasjay/data_journalism_portfolio/blob/main/reverse_engineering_project/analysis.Rmd). 

## Senior edition fact-check 

To fact-check [two graphics](https://dbknews.com/2021/04/27/senior-edition-looking-back-survey/) using survey data for The Diamondback's 2021 Senior Edition, I loaded and cleaned the data and performed some analysis on it.

I wrote and commented all code for the fact-check. 

See my work [here](https://github.com/sahanasjay/data_journalism_portfolio/blob/main/senior_edition_data_fact_check/senior_edition_data.Rmd). See the graphics [here](https://dbknews.com/2021/04/27/senior-edition-looking-back-survey/).
