## In-depth cleaning on lynching victim data 

I wrote the code in [victim_data_cleaning.Rmd](https://github.com/sahanasjay/data_journalism_portfolio/blob/main/victim_data_cleaning/victims_newspaper_lineage%20copy.Rmd) to scrub and combine three sets of data on lynching victims and people threatened with lynching. I used ifelse and mutate functions in conjunction to create a column that told a viewer whether and why I'd cleaned a date value. The project deepened my understanding of baseR functions, the tidyverse and janitor. 

I wrote this code for a Howard Center investigation into historically white-owned newspapersâ€™ role in supporting and inciting racial terror. The project will be published in December.
