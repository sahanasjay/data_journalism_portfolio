## In-depth cleaning on lynching victim data 

I wrote the script in [victim_data_cleaning.Rmd](https://github.com/sahanasjay/data_journalism_portfolio/blob/main/victim_data_cleaning/victims_newspaper_lineage%20copy.Rmd) to scrub and combine three sets of data on lynching victims and people threatened with lynching. The project deepened my understanding of the tidyverse and janitor packages â€” baseR functions, too.
