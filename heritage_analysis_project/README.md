# Analysis of Southern Poverty Law center's Whose Heritage database

I went through the process of creating a data-driven story, spearheading a small group of classmates to parse the Southern Poverty Law Center's "Whose Heritage?" database, which contains a count of statues, placards, public parks, buildings and other symbols dedicated to the Confederacy.

My analysis led to the finding that Northern states, though they have less confederate symbols than Southern states, have a higher percentage of symbols removed. Additionally, I pinpointed three trees named after Robert E. Lee in California National Parks that hadn't been removed or renamed, even after almost half of the state's confederate symbols had been taken down.

I edited, cleaned and commented all code for this project, and wrote the majority of it.
