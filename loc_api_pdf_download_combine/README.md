## Working with APIs, creating dynamic directory structures, automating guide text and binding pdfs

In [loc_api_pdf_download_combine.Rmd](https://github.com/sahanasjay/data_journalism_portfolio/blob/main/loc_api_pdf_download_combine/loc_pdf_download_and_package.Rmd), I wrote code that uses the Library of Congress' API to locate and download newspaper page PDFs and OCR text from the 60-day window surrounding a lynching date. As they're downloaded, one of my custom functions saves the files into a dynamic folder structure that reflects the newspaper each file belongs to. Another custom function binds PDFs into  packets, adding automated guidetext to help reporters navigate the contents of each booklet. I practiced error handling and  experimented with parallell processing, making my download code more efficient.

My work helped kick off the search for lynching coverage in newspapers, part of a Howard Center investigation into historically white-owned newspapersâ€™ role in supporting and inciting racial terror. The project will be published in December.
