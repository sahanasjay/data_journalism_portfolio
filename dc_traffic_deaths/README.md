## Spatial data analysis

I acquired, cleaned, joined and analyzed data to reveal how traffic fatalities in D.C. hit a high in 2021, nearly a decade after the city's mayor launched a strategy to reduce deaths — and lower-income communities bore the brunt of the impact.

I communicated with public information officials, hand-joined two datasets with no common id, taught myself to create choropleth maps and worked with spatial data to put this story together. My analysis identified the deadliest roads in D.C., and helped us tell the stories of some of folks who lost their lives on them.
