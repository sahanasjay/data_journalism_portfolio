## Spatial data analysis

I acquired, cleaned, joined and analyzed data to reveal how traffic fatalities in D.C. hit a high in 2021, nearly a decade after the city's mayor launched a strategy to reduce deaths â€” and lower-income communities were disproportionately impacted.

I communicated with public information officials, hand-joined two datasets with no common id, created choropleth maps and worked with spatial data to put this story together. My analysis identified  the deadliest roads in D.C., and helped us relate the stories of some of folks who lost their lives on them.
