## Coding a web scraper for the Library of Congress' website

I co-wrote [loc_scraper.ipnyb](https://github.com/sahanasjay/data_journalism_portfolio/blob/main/loc_webscraper/loc_scraper.ipynb), a scraper that uses a list of current newspaper titles from the Library of Congress' API to collect information on each paper's antecedents: their titles, the dates they ran, their URLS and their Library of Congress cataloguing numbers. The result is a newspaper "family tree"; a dataset connecting each current title with its historical relatives.  

Scraping this data was a crucial first step to finding out which current papers may have once covered lynching. The script was my first foray into Python — but my colleague and I had a working scraper running in about a week.

I wrote this code for a Howard Center investigation into historically white-owned newspapers’ role in supporting and inciting racial terror. The project will be published in December
