## Coding a web scraper for the Library of Congress' website
Starting with a list of current newspaper titles from the Library of Congress API, [loc_scraper.ipnyb](https://github.com/sahanasjay/data_journalism_portfolio/blob/main/loc_webscraper/loc_scraper.ipynb) collects information on each paper's antecedents — their titles, the dates they ran, the url and Library of Congress cataloguing number associated with each one. The result is a newspaper "family tree" of sorts that connects each current title with its historical relatives.  

Scraping this data was a crucial first step to finding out which current papers may have once covered lynching. The script was my first foray into Python — but my colleague and I had a working scraper running in about a week.

I wrote this code for Howard Center investigation into historically white-owned newspapers’ role in supporting and inciting racial terror. The project will be published in December
