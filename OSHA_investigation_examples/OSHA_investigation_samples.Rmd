##R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document, detailing some of the work I have completed on a long-term investigative project at the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism. The project looks into worker safety during COVID-19 â€” and the ways in which government agencies and private companies alike failed essential workers.

##Sources
####This function is not written by me. It was created by one of my colleagues at the Howard Center, and served to combine some of the data read in below.

```{r}

#Function to combine the federal osha database of state and osha plan offices into one file
source("sources/combine_osha_covid_19_complaint_data.R")
```

###Read in OSHA complaint data
```{r}
# read in closed complaints -------------------------
osha_closed_complaints = read_excel("data/Closed_Federal_State_Plan_COVID-19_Complaints_Through_0307_2021.xlsx")

# read in open complaints -------------------------
osha_open_complaints = read_excel("data/Open_Federal_and_State_Plan_Valid_Covid-19_Complaints_through_0307_2021.xlsx")

#combine ---------------------------------
osha_complaints = combine_osha(osha_open_complaints, osha_closed_complaints)
osha_complaints_date = "2021-03-07"

#add new features to osha complaints -------------------------

osha_complaints = osha_complaints %>% 
  mutate(months_between = time_length(interval(ymd(upa_receipt_date), ymd(osha_complaints_date)), "month"))

```


###Weighting by worker population
```{r}
# Data for weighting analysis -------------------------

# load 2020 employment data
# source: https://www.bls.gov/charts/state-employment-and-unemployment/employment-by-state-bar.htm

worker_data<- read_excel("data/employment_stats.xlsx")%>%
  clean_names()

federal_state_plan_key <- read_excel("data/federal_versus_state_key.xlsx",
    col_types = c("text", "text", "text"))

state_list<- fips_codes%>%
  distinct(state, state_name)

worker_data = left_join(worker_data, state_list, by = c("state" ="state_name" ))
worker_data = worker_data %>%  mutate(total_employment = total_employment_thousands * 1000) 

```

#Our recommendation: we should use the second table, which codes partials as federal plan and juices up federal numbers, with a sentence that says something like "In states where [these businesses] are covered by federal osha, there are seemingly less complaints per 10k workers"

##Analysis focused on New Mexico: function writing 
###Read in New Mexico State Plan outbreak data 
```{r}

# read in outbreak data with associated complaints 
nm_outbreaks_matches <- read_csv("new_mexico_data/verified_state_osha_matches_new_mexico.csv")%>%
  clean_names()

# read in outbreak data with no associated complaints 
nm_outbreaks_nonmatches <- read_csv("new_mexico_data/new_mexico_nonmatches.csv")%>%
  clean_names()

# read in raw outbreak data
nm_raw_outbreaks <- read_csv("new_mexico_data/new_mexico_rapid_responses_all.csv")%>%
  clean_names()

```

###Find the number of outbreaks, categorized by the number of associated cases, for each individual establishment in NM
```{r}

#creating a function called 'outbreaks_by_name'
outbreaks_by_name <- function(dataframe){
#extracting the name of the dataframe from the df we fed into the function
 df_name <- deparse(substitute(dataframe))
  df_name <- paste0("outbreaks_by_name_", df_name)
 #building meat of the function: defining what it does
 dataframe <- dataframe%>%
  group_by(name, number_of_positive_cases_reported)%>%
  count()%>%
  rename(number_outbreaks = n)%>%
  arrange(desc(number_of_positive_cases_reported))
  
 #taking the df we fed into function and pushing to global environment, and the name we give it in GE is the value we created in df_name 
 assign(df_name, dataframe, envir = .GlobalEnv)
  }

outbreaks_by_name(nm_outbreaks_nonmatches)
outbreaks_by_name(nm_outbreaks_matches)
outbreaks_by_name(nm_raw_outbreaks)

```

###Create another function give us the total number of cases at every unique establishement through all outbreaks 
```{r}
# create another function called 'cases_by_address'
cases_by_address <- function(x){
#extracting the name of the dataframe from the df we fed into the function
 df_name <- deparse(substitute(x))
  df_name <- paste0("cases_by_address_", df_name)
 #building meat of the function: defining what it does
 x <- x%>%
   group_by(name, address)%>%
   summarize(sum_cases = sum(number_of_positive_cases_reported))%>%
   arrange(desc(sum_cases))
 #taking the df we fed into function and pushing to global environment, and the name we give it in GE is the value we created in df_name 
 assign(df_name, x, envir = .GlobalEnv)
}

cases_by_address(nm_outbreaks_nonmatches)
cases_by_address(nm_outbreaks_matches)
cases_by_address(nm_raw_outbreaks)

```
