## Analysis of national OSHA records

The weighted comparative analysis in [OSHA_investigation_samples.Rmd](https://github.com/sahanasjay/data_journalism_portfolio/blob/main/OSHA_investigation_examples/OSHA_investigation_samples.Rmd) on OSHA complaints in federal and state-plan states returned one of the key findings in the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism's stories on worker safety during COVID-19.

The analysis I did to get a count of outbreaks in New Mexico stores revealed that nearly all the Walmart-owned stores in the state had seen an associated coronavirus outbreak.

Working on this project expanded my data analysis skills: In addition to learning how to create for loops and functions, I grew more comfortable with baseR, the tidyverse package, the lubridate package, the janitor package and many others.

I have a byline on the project, which was published on [AP](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-business-caf5e31d883a18deae6cd367a5ee8978) and picked up by several notable outlets â€” including The Washington Post.
